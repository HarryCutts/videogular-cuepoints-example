Videogular Cuepoints example
============================

This is a simple example for using [Videogular Cuepoints][vg-cuepoints]. To use it, fetch dependencies through [Bower](http://bower.io/), and then serve the folder with a web server (such as the one built in to Python):

```sh
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
